# Select-Query-Optimization

This is a DS implementation project and the basic point of motivation in this project is learning and implementing algorithms that reduces time and space complexity. The objective is to minimize the number of disk accesses and thus, this project is concerned with techniques for achieving that objective i.e. techniques for arranging the data on a disk so that any required piece of data, say some specific record, can be located in a few I/Oâ€™s as possible.
